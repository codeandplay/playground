## Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: Version 20.16.0
- **Three.js**: A powerful library for 3D graphics in the browser.
- **Leva**: A GUI for React that helps manage and visualize state in 3D applications.
- **React Fiber**: A reconciler for React that enables more flexible rendering.
- **React Three Drei**: A set of tools and abstractions for working with Three.js in React.
- **Rapier Physics Engine**: A fast and cross-platform physics engine designed for 2D and 3D physics simulations, often used with react-three/rapier for game physics.
- **React Spinners**: A collection of loading spinner components for React, useful for indicating loading states.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
